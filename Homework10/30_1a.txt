In the given program, at line number 30 scheduler has two choices of threads. One the main thread and thread with id 0.
The thread with id 0 will compute the run method where it will create two threads. One with id 1 and another with id 2.
At line number 12, scheduler has three(If main is terminated)/four(If main is not terminated) thread to choose from.
if thread with id 0 is choose, it will exceute next line and terminate or else it will wait on line 12 till the  scheduler assigns it.
Suppose the thread with id 0 and main thread terminates, the scheduler has two choices - thread with id 1 and 2.

case 1: if line 11 and 12 executes, T1 and T2 has now same object. If scheduler choose T1
> Key is available as no threads is executing the synchronized block
> It will execute the synchrionized block by receiving a key (setting a flag) from the object to execute this block.
> First this will print "1 --->"
> The initial value of counter is 0, therefore it will go into if block make counter value 1 and wait (gives the key back to object until it is notified).

Now, scheduler has only one choice of thread to choose from, the thread with id 2 executes.
> Since the thread 2 is initialized with same object (object has key available). So, it can execute the synchronized block.
> First this will print "2 --->"
> Counter is 1, so this will execute the else block. Here it will invoke notifyAll() method(This method releases all the thread in corresponding object wait).
> Now the secheduler has two threads to choose from, thread with id 1 and 2.
> Since the thread 2 haven't executed the synchronized block, the key is unavailable (flag not resetted) for thread 1 to execute the synchronized block.
> The thread 2 first completes the synchronized block, it will the print "2 <---" at line number 26 and gives back to key to the object(resetting the flag)

> Now, only one thread is remaining to choose thread 1, this will start from line number 20.
> Prints "1 <---" at line 26 and finishes the block by giving back the key(resetting the flag) and terminates
